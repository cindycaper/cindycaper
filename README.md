Hello, this is Cindycaper. A person who loves programming.
> My specialty

I love web page making and `Python`. Recently, I'm still learning `Python`. I have a soft spot for scripts, especially when I was 14 years old, I liked VBScript very much, which made me go further and further on the road of programming. I can help you make your web page, front-end design, dns and a series of other things-these I think I am proficient in. Of course, if you want to discuss `Python` with me, then I will be very happy.:laughing:
> About me

I remember I seem to have said-I like programming, especially now I'm learning `Python`. I'm going to have time to learn `C++`.Although it's difficult, it's really worth my efforts.:smile:
> About some questions

In fact, I like eating very much in reality, so I'm `hungry` now! ! !:sob:
